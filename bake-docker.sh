# This script overview:
# - Builds the necessary images for cabot on multiple platforms and pushes them to cmucal.
#   - Since push requires cmucal permissions, it is usually handled by an Action script.
# - If you want to debug by modifying the base image, perform a local build (-l).
#   - Set up a local registry server, build, and overwrite the cmucal image tag.
#   - It is also advisable to specify the platform (-p) in this case.
